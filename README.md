<p><a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Guess_a_number" target="_blank">Guess A Number</a> is a single-player game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number from the computer and the more numbers he has guessed correctly,  the <b>harder</b> the game becomes. The rules are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The player chooses a number <b>within the given range</b></li>
  <li>He recieves feedback on his guess, either: <b>"Too High"</b>, <b>"Too Low"</b> or he has guessed <b>correctly</b>, in which case he moves to the next level</li>
  <li>Each level the range of random numbers is increased by <b>100</b></li>
  <li>There is a total of <b>10 levels</b></li>
</ul>

<p>After completing the final 10th level, the player is crowned "THE KING OF GUESSING" and the game is over.</p>
